### Motivation

Recent events in American politics - a surging pro-life movement, an increasingly conservative Supreme Court, and pending litigation against the Affordable Care Act (ACA) will potentially restrict access to reproductive services & resources for women across the country. 

We seek to highlight the importance of such services by demonstrating how increased access to reproductive services decreases rates of STDs/STIs and maternal/infant mortality in New York City and how access varies by socioeconomic factors. 

### Final Products

- Geospatial map of availability of reproductive services
- Plots comparing levels of unwanted teen pregnancy, STDs/STIs, and maternal mortality with and without insurance coverage
- Scatter plot of prevalence of STDs/STIs by proximity to reproductive services 


### Data Sources

We plan to use a few datasets from the NYC Department of Health and Mental Hygiene to perform our analysis. 

- We will utilize the NYC OpenData [DOHMH Community Health Survey](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Health/DOHMH-Community-Health-Survey-2010-2016-/csut-3wpr) to obtain the prevalence of health care insurance coverage. 
- We will utilize the NYC OpenData [Condom Availability Program dataset](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Health/NYC-Condom-Availability-Program-HIV-condom-distrib/4kpn-sezh) to understand the availability of safer sex products. 
- We will utilize the NYC OpenData [Pregnancy-Associated Mortality dataset](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Health/Pregnancy-Associated-Mortality/27x4-cbi6) to analyze the distribution of maternal mortality. 
-We will utilize the NHANES 2017 data and use the variable INDFMIN2, representing total family income.(https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/Search/variablelist.aspx?Component=Demographics&CycleBeginYear=2017) 
- We will utilize the Guttmatcher Institute's Contraceptive Use Study to analyze the prevalence of national contraceptive use.(https://www.guttmacher.org/population-center/dataset/2012-2014-continuity-and-change-contraceptive-use-study) 

### Planned Analyses / Visualizations / Coding Challenges
Since we are analyzing multiple datasets, a possible coding challenge would be in figuring out specific relevant variables and how to manipulate them. 



### Planned Timeline 

- November 13th: Literature review and finalize variables of interest in project review meeting
- November 20th: Read in and tidy datasets, assign plot creations 
- November 27th: Project analysis, visualizations, and discussion of results
- November 30th: Finalize written report with project details
- December 4th: Finalize project report, webpage, and screencast
