### Motivation

Recent events in American politics - a surging pro-life movement, an increasingly conservative Supreme Court, and pending litigation against the Affordable Care Act (ACA) will potentially restrict access to reproductive services & resources for women across the country. 

We seek to highlight the importance of such services by demonstrating how increased access to sexual health education & reproductive services decrease rates of unwanted teen pregnancy, STDs/STIs, and maternal/infant mortality.
