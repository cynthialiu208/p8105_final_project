### Motivation

Recent events in American politics - a surging pro-life movement, an increasingly conservative Supreme Court, and pending litigation against the Affordable Care Act (ACA) will potentially restrict access to reproductive services & resources for women across the country. 

We seek to highlight the importance of such services by demonstrating how increased access to sexual health education & reproductive services decrease rates of unwanted teen pregnancy, STDs/STIs, and maternal/infant mortality in New York City. 

### Final Products

- Geospatial map of availability of reproductive services
- Plots comparing levels of unwanted teen pregnancy, STDs/STIs, and maternal mortality with and without insurance coverage
- Scatter plot of prevalence of STDs/STIs by proximity to reproductive services 


### Data Sources

We plan to use a few datasets from the NYC Department of Health and Mental Hygiene to perform our analysis. 

- We will utilize the NYC OpenData [DOHMH Community Health Survey](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Health/DOHMH-Community-Health-Survey-2010-2016-/csut-3wpr) to obtain the prevalence of health care insurance coverage. 
- We will utilize the NYC OpenData [Condom Availability Program dataset](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Health/NYC-Condom-Availability-Program-HIV-condom-distrib/4kpn-sezh) to understand the availability of safer sex products. 
- We will utilize the NYC OpenData [Pregnancy-Associated Mortality dataset](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Health/Pregnancy-Associated-Mortality/27x4-cbi6) to analyze the distribution of maternal mortality.
