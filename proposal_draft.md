### Motivation

Recent events in American politics - a surging pro-life movement, an
increasingly conservative Supreme Court, and pending litigation against
the Affordable Care Act (ACA) will potentially restrict access to
reproductive services & resources for women across the country.

We seek to highlight the importance of such services by demonstrating
how increased access to reproductive services decreases rates of
STDs/STIs and maternal mortality in New York City and nationally, and
how these health outcomes vary by socioeconomic factors like income and
race.

### Final Products

  - Geospatial map of availability of reproductive services
  - Plots comparing levels of STDs/STIs, and maternal mortality with and
    without insurance coverage
  - Scatter plot of prevalence of STDs/STIs by proximity to reproductive
    services
  - Website of project description, analysis and visualizations
  - Screencast of website

### Data Sources

We plan to use a few datasets from the NYC Department of Health and
Mental Hygiene to perform our analysis.

  - We will utilize the NYC OpenData [DOHMH Community Health
    Survey](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Health/DOHMH-Community-Health-Survey-2010-2016-/csut-3wpr)
    to obtain the prevalence of health care insurance coverage.
  - We will utilize the NYC OpenData [Condom Availability Program
    dataset](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Health/NYC-Condom-Availability-Program-HIV-condom-distrib/4kpn-sezh)
    to understand the availability of safer sex products.
  - We will utilize the NYC OpenData [Pregnancy-Associated Mortality
    dataset](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Health/Pregnancy-Associated-Mortality/27x4-cbi6)
    to analyze the distribution of maternal mortality.
  - We will utilize the [NHANES 2017
    data](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/Search/variablelist.aspx?Component=Demographics&CycleBeginYear=2017)
    and use the variable INDFMIN2, representing total family income.
  - We will utilize the [Guttmatcher Institute’s Contraceptive Use
    Study](https://www.guttmacher.org/population-center/dataset/2012-2014-continuity-and-change-contraceptive-use-study)
    to analyze the prevalence of national contraceptive use.

### Planned Analyses / Visualizations / Coding Challenges

  - We anticipate using QGIS to map access to reproductive services on a
    national level and how it may vary by state.
  - We will run regression models to look at how socioeconomic factors
    such as income and race and access to reproductive services impact
    maternal mortality and STD/STI rates.
  - Since we are analyzing multiple datasets, a possible coding
    challenge is identifying the relevant variables of interest and
    determining how to manipulate the datasets.

### Planned Timeline

  - November 13th: Literature review and finalize variables of interest
    in project review meeting
  - November 20th: Read in and tidy datasets, assign plot creations
  - November 27th: Project analysis, visualizations, and discussion of
    results
  - November 30th: Finalize written report with project details
  - December 4th: Finalize project report, webpage, and screencast
